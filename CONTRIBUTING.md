I think I will open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021.

# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2021 Contributors

I will definitely consider pull requests associated with an issue and maybe consider pull requests associated with a 
TODO (considered an Action Item in NetBeans).

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free) and JUnit. This project uses Java 8 and 
JUnit 5. Contributors may use later versions of Java provided they don't use features not available in Java 8.
